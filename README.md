This Jupyter notebook allows you to upload your transaction history and categorizes them for you.

As I've delved into GitHub, Jupyter notebooks, and Python, I've been eager to apply my newly acquired skills to create something practical for personal use.

While there's still work to be done, I am pleased with the progress made so far.
